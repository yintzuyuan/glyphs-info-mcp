## [Community](#glyphs/community)

Glyphs is also a vibrant community.
On our website you will find many ways to get involved.
We encourage you to use the [Forum](https://forum.glyphsapp.com) to ask questions and discuss issues with other users and the developers.
The [Learn section](https://glyphsapp.com/learn) has a large collection of tutorials, screencasts, online classes and other educational material.
Keep an eye out for workshops, conferences, and the latest updates in the [News section](https://glyphsapp.com/news).
If you are planning a workshop, organizing a Glyphs-related event, or releasing a plug-in you have developed, we will be happy to share your contribution on [glyphsapp.com](https://glyphsapp.com).
