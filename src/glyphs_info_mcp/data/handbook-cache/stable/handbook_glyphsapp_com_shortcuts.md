## [Shortcuts](#settings/shortcuts)

![](https://handbook.glyphsapp.com/v/content/images/root/settings-shortcuts.png)

The `Shortcuts` settings allow recording keyboard shortcuts for frequently used actions.
Invoke a shortcut by pressing one or more modifier keys (⌘ `Command`, ⌥ `Option`, ⌃ `Control`, ⇧ `Shift`) and a regular key like `A`, `5`, `Return`, or `Escape`.

Click `Record shortcut` and press a shortcut on the keyboard to add the shortcut to the selected action.
Keep the current shortcut by clicking the curved arrow ![](https://handbook.glyphsapp.com/v/content/icons/abort-shortcut.svg) icon, or click the cross ![](https://handbook.glyphsapp.com/v/content/icons/clear-shortcut.svg) icon to remove the current shortcut from an action:

Shortcuts are shown using key symbols:

Use the buttons at the top of the `Shortcuts` settings window to filter the actions list. `All` shows all actions, `Customized` lists only the actions with a changed shortcut, `Menu` shows all actions accessible from the menu bar at the top of the screen, and `Commands` shows actions within the current selection.

Actions are grouped into sections.
Click the disclosure chevron ![](https://handbook.glyphsapp.com/v/content/icons/disclosure-chevron.svg) next to the title of a section to collapse and expand the section.
Filter the list of actions further by searching for actions with the search field in the top-right.

# [Edit View](#edit-view)

Edit glyph outlines, spacing, kerning, mark-positioning, hinting, and more in Edit View.
Edit a glyph by double-clicking it.
Open multiple glyphs in Edit View by selecting them and choosing `View → New Tab` (`Cmd-T`).
In Font View, a selection of glyphs can also be edited by double-clicking the selection or pressing `Cmd-Down Arrow`.

A Glyphs window can contain multiple Edit View tabs.
Switch to a tab by clicking its tab title.
Press `Cmd-Opt-2` through `Cmd-Opt-9` to switch to the respective tab.
`Cmd-Opt-1` switches to [Font View](https://handbook.glyphsapp.com/single-page/#font-view "Font View"), which is always the first tab in the window.

Switch to the next or previous tab with `View → Navigation → Show Next Tab` (`Ctrl-Tab`) or `Show Previous Tab` (`Ctrl-Shift-Tab`).
Close a tab by moving the mouse cursor over its title and clicking the close ![](https://handbook.glyphsapp.com/v/content/icons/close-tab.svg) button or choosing `View → Close Tab` (`Cmd-Shift-W`).
Close all tabs except for the current one by holding down the `Option` key when clicking the close button.
Restore an accidentally closed tab by holding down `Option` and choosing `View → Reopen Last Closed Tab` (`Cmd-Opt-Shift-W`).

Edit View has two modes: *text mode* and *edit mode*.

- Use text mode to insert and remove glyphs from Edit View, or adjust the spacing and kerning between glyphs.
  Choose the Text tool ![](https://handbook.glyphsapp.com/v/content/icons/text-tool.svg) (shortcut `T`) to enter text mode.
  See [Entering Text](https://handbook.glyphsapp.com/single-page/#entering-text "Edit View ⯈ Entering Text") and [Spacing & Kerning](https://handbook.glyphsapp.com/single-page/#spacing-and-kerning "Spacing & Kerning") for more details.
- Enter edit mode by choosing a different tool or by double-clicking a glyph.
  Or, press the `Escape` key to edit the glyph located after the text cursor.
